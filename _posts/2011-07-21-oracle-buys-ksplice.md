# {{ page.title }}

I am *extremely* saddened to see that [ksplice](http://ksplice.com) has been [bought out](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/ksplice/customer-letter-430127.html) by Oracle and will no longer be supporting Redhat Enterprise. I can only hope that the Linux community can find a way to provide this service outside of the limited confines of Oracle Corp.
