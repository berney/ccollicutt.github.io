# {{ page.title }}

I've decided to get back into information security. I used to do a lot more infosec related work, including being the security administrator for a large university. To that effect, I'm doing some security blogging over at [Flatline Security](https://flatlinesecurity.com) and I'll write posts about the things I learn about infosec as I refresh my knowledge. There are a couple of certifications I'm going to work on as well, such as the _Certified Ethical Hacker_ qualification.

I don't know whether it's a good idea to have two different but slightly related blogs, but I'm going to give it a try. serverascode.com will be for sysadmin related posts, and Flatline Security for information security associated writing. I think Flatline might have less technical posts occasionally, and more philosophical or high level concepts.

I have a few ideas for blog posts here, and will soon have more time to write articles. If you have any ideas for what you'd like to see, let me know in the comments.
