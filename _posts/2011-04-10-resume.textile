h2. Goals

I would like to continue working with Linux, OpenBSD, OpenStack, Python, "Ansible":http://ansible.cc and other great Open Source software ("and hardware":http://opencompute.org) projects, especially projects related to devops, security, the "cloud," performance, monitoring, and modern storage systems such as object storage and those using solid state devices. I'm also interested in increasing my knowledge of networking, such as projects like Neutron in OpenStack, software defined networking, as well as how large networks are constructed with techonologies such as MPLS, BPG, etc.

h2. Background

Most of my career has been spent in systems administration (now devops) and information security.

I previously worked for a world-class library at a large Canadian university that wanted to archive and store digital artifacts for 500+ years. That meant I learned about many modern storage systems--and I'm not just talking about your standard head-based fibre SAN, because that model just doesn't work for every situation. We needed "checksumming filesystems":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS and/or object storage.

While working at the library I was lucky enough to travel to San Francisco and meet the people behind the "Internet Archive":http://archive.org (an organization that has eight or nine petabytes of storage) find out what they were doing, and bring those concepts back and work on implementing some of them. I also worked with projects as diverse as a Canada-wide L2 networking to sync iRODS instances. Nothing like pinging a private network that is thousands of kilometres away. :)

Prior to working in a library (which I can assure you is quite an experience, walking through the stacks to get to your office is amazing), I worked as a Systems Administrator at a large Canadian Online and and Distance Education university on several research projects as well as with scaling educational information systems such as Moodle. We  used Redhat Enterprise and Xen and KVM based virtualization quite heavily. In this position I was able to work on several performance testing projects, such as pushing millions and millions of messages through Zimbra using Jmeter, as well as package many systems into "RPM":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager.

I gained the bulk of my security experience--and my understanding that "siloing" is not the best way to create security--at the same university where I was the Security Systems Administrator. I worked on firewalls (of course), intrusion detection, and layered security. There I began the process of moving the university away from a single monolithic commercial firewall to multiple firewalls based on OpenBSD.
