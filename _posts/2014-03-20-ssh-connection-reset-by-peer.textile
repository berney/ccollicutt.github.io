For the people of the future, the ones who get an error message about connections being reset by peer when trying to ssh into a server, check to see if the server does indeed have server keys in /etc/ssh/*key*. I spent like an hour or more looking into this. I'm not sure why, but an Ubuntu image I was using wouldn't create the servers ssh keys, though the files were there they were just of zero size.

Below is an example of an attempted connection.

<pre>
<code>
root# ssh -vvvv ubuntu@192.168.122.217

</pre>

To fix this I regenerated the keys and restarted. Then I was able to ssh into the server.

<pre>
<code>
root# ssh-keygen -q -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key -N '' -t rsa1
root# ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N '' -t rsa
root# ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key -N '' -t dsa
root# service ssh restart
</code>
</pre>

I have no idea why this is happening in this image.
